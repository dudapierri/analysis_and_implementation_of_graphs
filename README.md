# analysis_and_implementation_of_graphs
This code uses the Python language and has an interactive graphical interface. The objective of the study was to work and manipulate graphs simply and interactively.

In this code, it is possible to create directed and undirected graphs with weighted and unweighted edges, add and remove vertices and edges, and perform breadth-first search, depth-first search, PRIM algorithm, ROY algorithm, minimum graph coloring, check if the graph is planar and calculate the A* algorithm. The system initializes with a base graph (which should be set in the JSON file) and when clicking on the reset button the default graph should be displayed.
